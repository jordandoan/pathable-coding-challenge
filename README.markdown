## Pathable Coding Challenge

Hi, and thanks for playing!

We challenge you to create a basic list implementation using Backbone.js.

To play, please fork this repository, open up the index.html file in a browser
and hack away. When you're done, create patch files for your changes (`git
format-patch origin/master..HEAD`) and attach them in an email to
careers@pathable.com

### Good luck!
